`DiffDRR` is a PyTorch-based digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generator that provides

1. Auto-differentiable DRR syntheisis
2. GPU-accelerated rendering
3. A pure Python implementation

Most importantly, `DiffDRR` implements DRR synthesis as a PyTorch module, making it interoperable in deep learning pipelines.

## Installation Guide

To install `DiffDRR` from PyPI:
```zsh
pip install diffdrr
```

`DiffDRR` also requires `PyTorch3D`, which gives us the ability to use multiple parameterizations of SO(3) when constructing camera poses! For most users,
```zsh
conda install pytorch3d -c pytorch3d
```
should work perfectly well. Otherwise, see PyTorch3D's [installation guide](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

### Development (optional)

`DiffDRR` source code, docs, and CI are all built using
[`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). To get set up with `nbdev`, install
the following

``` zsh
mamba install jupyterlab nbdev -c fastai -c conda-forge 
nbdev_install_quarto  # To build docs
nbdev_install_hooks  # Make notebooks git-friendly
```

Running `nbdev_help` will give you the full list of options. The most
important ones are

``` zsh
nbdev_preview  # Render docs locally and inspect in browser
nbdev_prepare  # NECESSARY BEFORE PUSHING: builds package, tests notebooks, and builds docs in one step
```

For more details, follow this [in-depth
tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html).

## Usage

The following minimal example specifies the geometry of the projectional radiograph imaging system and traces rays through a CT volume:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch

from diffdrr.drr import DRR
from diffdrr.data import load_example_ct
from diffdrr.visualization import plot_drr

# Read in the volume and get the isocenter
volume, spacing = load_example_ct()
bx, by, bz = torch.tensor(volume.shape) * torch.tensor(spacing) / 2

# Initialize the DRR module for generating synthetic X-rays
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
drr = DRR(
    volume,      # The CT volume as a numpy array
    spacing,     # Voxel dimensions of the CT
    sdr=300.0,   # Source-to-detector radius (half of the source-to-detector distance)
    height=200,  # Height of the DRR (if width is not seperately provided, the generated image is square)
    delx=4.0,    # Pixel spacing (in mm)
).to(device)

# Set the camera pose with rotation (yaw, pitch, roll) and translation (x, y, z)
rotation = torch.tensor([[torch.pi, 0.0, torch.pi / 2]], device=device)
translation = torch.tensor([[bx, by, bz]], device=device)

# 📸 Also note that DiffDRR can take many representations of SO(3) 📸
# For example, quaternions, rotation matrix, axis-angle, etc...
img = drr(rotation, translation, parameterization="euler_angles", convention="ZYX")
plot_drr(img, ticks=False)
plt.show()
```

On a single NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU, producing such an image takes

    33.3 ms ± 6.78 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

The full example is available at
[`introduction.ipynb`](https://vivekg.dev/DiffDRR/tutorials/introduction.html).

## Application: 6-DoF Slice-to-Volume Registration

We demonstrate the utility of our auto-differentiable DRR generator by
solving a 6-DoF registration problem with gradient-based optimization.
Here, we generate two DRRs:

1.  A fixed DRR from a set of ground truth parameters
2.  A moving DRR from randomly initialized parameters

To solve the registration problem, we use gradient descent to maximize
an image loss similarity metric between the two DRRs. This produces
optimization runs like this:

The full example is available at
[`optimizers.ipynb`](https://vivekg.dev/DiffDRR/tutorials/optimizers.html).

## How does `DiffDRR` work?

`DiffDRR` reformulates Siddon’s method,[^1] the
canonical algorithm for calculating the radiologic path of an X-ray
through a volume, as a series of vectorized tensor operations. This
version of the algorithm is easily implemented in tensor algebra
libraries like PyTorch to achieve a fast auto-differentiable DRR
generator.
