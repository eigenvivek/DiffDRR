`DiffDRR` is a PyTorch-based digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generator that provides

1. Auto-differentiable DRR syntheisis
2. GPU-accelerated rendering
3. A pure Python implementation

Most importantly, `DiffDRR` implements DRR synthesis as a PyTorch module, making it interoperable in deep learning pipelines.

## Installation Guide

To install `DiffDRR` from PyPI:
```zsh
pip install diffdrr
```

## Usage

The following minimal example specifies the geometry of the projectional radiograph imaging system and traces rays through a CT volume:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch

from diffdrr.drr import DRR
from diffdrr.data import load_example_ct
from diffdrr.visualization import plot_drr

# Read in the volume
volume, spacing = load_example_ct()

# Initialize the DRR module for generating synthetic X-rays
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
drr = DRR(
    volume,      # The CT volume as a numpy array
    spacing,     # Voxel dimensions of the CT
    sdr=300.0,   # Source-to-detector radius (half of the source-to-detector distance)
    height=200,  # Height of the DRR (if width is not seperately provided, the generated image is square)
    delx=4.0,    # Pixel spacing (in mm)
).to(device)

# Set the camera pose with rotations (yaw, pitch, roll) and translations (x, y, z)
rotations = torch.tensor([[torch.pi, 0.0, torch.pi / 2]], device=device)
bx, by, bz = torch.tensor(volume.shape) * torch.tensor(spacing) / 2
translations = torch.tensor([[bx, by, bz]], device=device)

# Make the DRR
img = drr(rotations, translations)
plot_drr(img, ticks=False)
plt.show()
```

On a single NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU, producing such an image takes

    34.9 ms ± 32.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

The full example is available at
[`introduction.ipynb`](https://vivekg.dev/DiffDRR/tutorials/introduction.html).

## Application: 6-DoF Slice-to-Volume Registration

We demonstrate the utility of our auto-differentiable DRR generator by
solving a 6-DoF registration problem with gradient-based optimization.
Here, we generate two DRRs:

1.  A fixed DRR from a set of ground truth parameters
2.  A moving DRR from randomly initialized parameters

To solve the registration problem, we use gradient descent to maximize
an image loss similarity metric between the two DRRs. This produces
optimization runs like this:

The full example is available at
[`optimizers.ipynb`](https://vivekg.dev/DiffDRR/tutorials/optimizers.html).

## How does `DiffDRR` work?

`DiffDRR` reformulates Siddon’s method ([Siddon RL. Fast calculation of
the exact radiological path for a three-dimensional CT array. Medical
Physics, 2(12):252–5, 1985.](https://doi.org/10.1118/1.595715)), the
canonical algorithm for calculating the radiologic path of an X-ray
through a volume, as a series of vectorized tensor operations. This
version of the algorithm is easily implemented in tensor algebra
libraries like PyTorch to achieve a fast auto-differentiable DRR
generator.
